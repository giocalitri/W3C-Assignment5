1- Hangman: images and idea based on http://www.huntingground.freeserve.co.uk/main/mainfram.htm?../games/hangman/hangman1.htm
   All the code has been rewritten
2- Web application, no widget
3- Use different images,
4- if local and session storage are not available, the game remeber the statistics only for the current session,  
   otherwise it remembers everything
5- if native JSON is not available, I load a specific class
